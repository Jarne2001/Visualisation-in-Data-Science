# Visualisation-in-Data-Science
Repository for creating data visualisations based on the Madrid air quality data from 2001-2018 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/decide-soluciones/air-quality-madrid).

To recreate the graphs, first create the respective datasets extracted from the original H5 file in Python. The Daily Means dataset is used for the graphs produced in R, the other dataset is used for the other graphs produced in Python.

The MadridVisualisation.R code produces several graphs for the air pollution evolution from 2001-2018 for the yearly means, monthly means and daily means, however the daily means graphs were used as the final graphs.

The Python codes produce the remaining graphs used in the final report.
